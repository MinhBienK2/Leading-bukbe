## Features

> This project is **NOT** a framework, UI component library or a design system. The only purpose of this template is to assist you starting your CRA app with a solid tool stack and development patterns. It's 100% customizable. After you start your journey and once you understand the concepts offered here you should personalize your code accordingly instead of being tied to the starter project.
>
> You can add or remove literally anything and use whichever library or tools you prefer.
